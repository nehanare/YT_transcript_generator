1. We will be using Python 3.x, so make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
Once Python is installed, install Flask, Pytube, and YouTube Transcript API.

2. Create the Flask Application
create a new file called app.py and import the necessary libraries.
Next, create a new Flask application with the Flask class.

3. Define two routes: / and /transcript.
The / route is the home page of the web application. It displays an HTML form where the user can enter the URL of the YouTube video. The /transcript route is the route that generates the transcript for the video.

4. Next, Create the HTML templates for the web pages. Create three templates: home.html, transcript.html, and error.html.

5. Now test the web application. Save the app.py, home.html, transcript.html, and error.html files in the same directory, and run command python app.py in a terminal or command prompt:
This command will start the Flask application, and you should see an output similar to the following:
* Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)

By following the steps you should be able to create your own web application that generates transcripts for YouTube videos with timestamps.

You can customize the web application by modifying the HTML templates or adding more functionality to the Python code.
